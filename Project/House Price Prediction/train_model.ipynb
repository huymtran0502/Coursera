    "The model utilized 934 data points for training and 234 data points for testing. In the test set, the average sale price was $175,000. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is a suitable metric for understanding the model's output because it can be interpreted on the same scale as the dependent variable, which in this case is the sale price. With an RMSE of 10,552, it means that, on average, the model's predictions missed the correct sale prices by a little over $10,000. Considering the average sale price of $175,000, this level of deviation is not significant.\r\n",

    "The RMSE is a widely used measure in machine learning and statistics to assess the accuracy of a predictive model. It provides a straightforward interpretation of the overall error of the model, making it accessible even to individuals without a strong statistical background. However, it's important to note that the RMSE is not the only metric used for model evaluation. Depending on the specific problem and context, other metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared, or precision and recall may also be relevant.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Overall, the model's performance, as indicated by the RMSE, suggests that it is reasonably accurate in predicting sale prices, with an average deviation of around $10,000 from the actual prices."
